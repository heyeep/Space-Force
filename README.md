## Motivation
Space Force is based on the classical game, Space Invaders, which is known virtually everywhere.
The decision to choose this game among other projects was that everyone is familiar with some
version of it. The game mechanics is widely universal and easy to comprehend, this made it a clear choice to
finish the skeleton of the game in such a short time span.

## Background
This was a school project done in the summer of 2018. The goal of the
project was to work with a team to understand the software development
life cycle. The project was done with 3 other members and was never meant
to be a complete project.
